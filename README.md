# NextJS Router Matcher

Want to use [nextjs-style routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes)
without the [next module](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)? This module lets
you easily match routes. This code was adapted directly from the NextJS
implementation.

```ts

```

## Installation

```bash
yarn add next-route-matcher
```
